# todo
Simple TODO app in JavaScript.

This application is meant to be some kind of boilerplate for me to learn about the various tools used in web development (webdev).

## Conventions

### CSS

* Use of BEM.

### Installation and Build
Install nvm (https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/blob/master/README.md)
* `curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.0/install.sh | bash`

Install node
* `nvm install v16.12.0`

Install npm modules

### Deployment
* Set environment variable `NODE_ENV` to `production` to speed up initial build with no cache
